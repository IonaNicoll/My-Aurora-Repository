			<p>The desert-dwelling dunewalker elves match other elves in height and weight. Their coloration is typically darker, ranging from warm tawny and golden shades to deep sepia tones. Their eyes are amber, brown, or black. Dunewalker elf hair usually comes in shades of brown or black, though some have hair of a dark auburn or copper color.</p>
      <p>Dunewalker elves are canny survivors and hunters, aware of the precious resources and dire dangers of their harsh lands. They step lightly across the sands and seem to simply vanish right before one's eyes, as if they were nothing more than a mirage conjured by the heat.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Desert Dweller.</em></strong> You are adapted to life in then desert. You suffer no ill effects from high temperatures, and you require no additional water in such conditions. You have proficiency in the Survival skill.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Desert Mirage.</em></strong> While outdoors in a sunny area with an ambient temperature warmer than freezing, you can use a bonus action to create a minor natural phenomenon that surrounds you and up to a number of allies within 10 feet of you equal to your proficiency bonus. The mirage lightly obscures each of you from the view of any creature more than 30 feet away from you for 1 minute. For the duration, each target can attempt to hide even if a target is obscured only by this mirage. You can't use this train again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Dunewalker Elf Weapon Training.</em></strong> You have proficiency with the longbow, scimitar, shortbow, and spear.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sand Spirit.</em></strong> Difficult terrain comprised of sand or similar desert environs doesn't cost you extra movement.</p>
